# ReactLibra
In this open source project lead by the Pngme team supported by the Libracamp grant program, we will build 
a React Native wrapper for a Libra mobile light client.

# Description 

Create a React Native wrapper for a Libra mobile light client that provides private key generation, management, and abstracting the need to dive into native code by keeping the interface in Javascript. The wrapper will allow for easy maintenance of key management primitives and easy implementation across low-power and full-feature React Native Android devices in emerging markets. This can extend a non-custodial Libra wallet with simple UI/UX  to any React Native app. In addition, we will implement an on-device keystore for storing a user's private key - this will be compatible with Android and iOS keystore standards. 

Lastly we will create a standard schema for UI/UX flow that includes key generation and recovery - leading to a best in class user experience. We will explore multi-party key recovery as a stretch goal using something like a  n-1 of n schema where n>5 trusted parties recompile a sharded private key.
